# bikeability

How bike-able is your city? Actually, what does that even mean? This is a collection of tools to get information on Bike-friendly routes of travel, and, hopefully, try to better understand what makes an urban area "Biker Friendly".

## components
There are several elements to this repo:
* tools for retrieving data (primarily from OSM)
* tools for cleaning and organizing data 
* tools for visualizing and compariing data
* Notebooks for a more user friendly/descriptive interface
